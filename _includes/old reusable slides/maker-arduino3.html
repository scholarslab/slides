  <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Working with Arduinos III</h1>
  <p>Thursday, February 26</br>2:00 - 3:30pm</br>Alderman Library, Room 421</p>
  <p>New to microcontrollers? Or used an Arduino before and want more time to play in a supportive environment? Come on by! Arduino is a tool for making microcomputers that can sense and control the physical world. This workshop will introduce participants to the basics of physical computing and programming through a series of hands-on exercises using our Arduino kits. This workshop builds on the Working with Arduino I and II workshops, but theyâ€™re not required to attend this one. Instructor: Jeremy Boggs</p>
