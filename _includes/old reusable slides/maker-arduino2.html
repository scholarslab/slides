  <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Working with Arduino II</h1>
  <p>Wednesday, November 4</br>12:30 - 2:00pm</br>Alderman Library, Room 421</p>
  <p>Did you miss October 28 workshop on working with Arduino, or were you hoping to experiment more with the technology? Join the second of two workshops on Wednesday, November 4 in the Scholarsâ€™ Lab Makerspace to gain an introduction to the basics of physical computing, components of the Arduino software, and examples of projects that used the software. Like in the first workshop, we will also begin getting our hands dirty with the technology, and those who have more advanced physical computing skills are free to work ahead, more independently on prototyping projects. Instructor: Margaret Furr</p>
