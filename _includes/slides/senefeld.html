  <h1>Emily Senefeld, Graduate Fellow in Digital Humanities</h1>
  <p>Emily&#8217s research focuses on how the Highlander Folk School&#8217;s staff used folk music and dancing, labor plays, and documentary films in labor and civil rights organizing from the 1930s to 1960s. She is using Omeka to build Neatline exhibits digitally mapping these cultural programs in order to shed new light on the network of radical activists operating in the South in the mid-twentieth century.</p>
