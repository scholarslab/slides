  <h1>Praxis 2017-2018: "Augmenting the University"</h1>
  <p>The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort is working on transforming the University of Virginia Grounds into a dynamic and virtually interactive space through the use of mobile augmented reality (AR) applications so as to retell stories that have been forgotten and make innovative connections between people and the spaces they inhabit. We hope to use AR technology to encourage critical engagement with familiar spaces and objects in order to reflect anew on the structure, culture, mission and history of the university.</p>

  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>
