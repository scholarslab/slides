  <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Introduction to Omeka</h1>
  <p>Wednesday, September 23</br>1:00 - 2:30pm</br>Alderman Library, Room 423</p>
  <p>Omeka was created to enable scholars, archives, libraries, museums, and independent researchers to build online exhibits of their work without having to know HTML or CSS. If you have a collection of digital resources that you want to exhibit on the web, Omeka could be a great tool to have in your toolkit. Instructor: Ronda Grizzle</p>
