  <h1>Digital Skriker</h1>
  <p>Kelli Shermeyer’s (English) project uses motion capture and virtual reality technologies to explore Caryl Churchill’s <i>The Skriker</i> (1994). She is interested not only in how these technologies might change the way we think about documenting stage movement and gesture, but also how they may enable new modes of performance, using “digital” space and nonhuman actors as part of an immersive and/or site-specific theatre practice.
