    <p>Please join us the final presentation of the 2018-2019 Praxis Program fellows. The Fellows will present <i>Unclosure: An Act for the Encouragement of Learning</i>, a project that explores the possibilities for digital research, pedagogy, and play in the newly expanded public domain. Using Robert Frostâ€™s <i>New Hampshire</i> (1923) as raw material, Unclosure presents a series of tutorials that seek to empower researchers, instructors, and creators to critically engage public-domain materials.
