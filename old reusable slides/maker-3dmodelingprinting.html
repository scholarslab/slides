  <h1>Workshop: Intro to 3D Printing</h1>
  <p>Wednesday, September 21</br>2:00 - 3:30pm</br>Alderman Library, Room 423</p>
  <p>Are you curious about 3D printing but unsure where to start? Have you had a bit of experience with modeling, but you want to continue to explore? This workshop will introduce participants to the exciting world of desktop fabrication. We’ll provide a brief overview of current trends and tools for 3D modeling and printing. We’ll also go over the basics of model creation with photogrammetry, and discuss how 3D printing works, including a live demonstration. While not necessary, participants can bring a camera (cell phone cameras welcome!) and a laptop to get better acquainted with the software we’ll introduce. Instructor: Shane Lin</p>
